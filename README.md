# Equivalence Classes

These files are associated with the AMIA 2019 Workshop W17: FHIR forms, flowsheets, and other EHR functions for FHIR.

Equivalence classes are well defined mathematical concepts (also defined in R, the statistical program). You can group elements according to characteristics. We created such classes based on pragmatic user modifiable groups of LOINC terms. These files represent Chemistry, Microbiology, and Drug Toxicity studies
